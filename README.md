The functionalities of this project are creating, reading, updating and deleting data. So, the project uses dotnet for the backend and angular for the frontend. 
This is the frontend part of the code which deals with user requests, and the backend part of the code can be found here https://github.com/Armin0001/CoffeeApi-Project, which processes those requests and sends the response back to the frontend.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
